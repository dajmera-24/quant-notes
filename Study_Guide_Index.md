## 🎯 HOW TO USE EACH FILE TYPE

### **Problems-Only Files (BEST FOR PRACTICE)**
```
Best for: Timed practice, testing yourself, building speed

How to use:
1. Set timer for 90 seconds
2. Write down your work
3. Submit your answer
4. ONLY THEN check solutions file
5. Note any mistakes
6. Move to next problem
```

### **Solutions-Only Files (VERIFICATION)**
```
Best for: Checking your work, understanding gaps

How to use:
1. After completing a problem from Problems-Only
2. Compare your work
3. Note the approach
4. If you got it right: celebrate! Move on
5. If you got it wrong: understand why
6. Re-attempt similar problem type later
```

### **Practice with Solutions (LEARNING)**
```
Best for: First time learning a concept, understanding methodology

How to use:
1. Read problem
2. Try for 90 seconds
3. If stuck, read solution
4. Understand the approach
5. Close solutions file
6. Try a different problem of same type from Problems-Only
```

### **Formulas Guide (REFERENCE)**
```
Best for: Memorization, formula lookup during practice

How to use:
- Week 1: Read through, write by hand to memorize
- Weeks 2-4: Quick reference during timed practice
- Day of test: Final review of all formulas
```

## 📈 TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

### **Create a Tracking Sheet**

```
Date | Problem Set | # Correct/Total | % | Time | Notes
-----|-------------|-----------------|---|------|----------
12/3 | General A   | 5/5             | 100% | 7:30 | Easy
12/3 | General B   | 4/5             | 80%  | 7:45 | B3 was tough
12/4 | Trading 1-6 | 4/6             | 67%  | 9:15 | Need work on conditional
```

### **Target Metrics**
- **General Easy (A1-A5)**: 100% accuracy, under 6 min total
- **General Intermediate (B1-B5)**: 90%+ accuracy, under 8 min total
- **General Hard (C1-C10)**: 70%+ accuracy, under 15 min total
- **Trading Problems**: 70%+ accuracy, under 15 min (10 problems)

## 🧠 KEY PROBLEM-TYPE QUICK IDs

When you see a problem, identify it immediately:

| Pattern | Approach | File |
|---------|----------|------|
| "At least one" | Use complement: 1 - P(none) | General A5, BTO 1-3 |
| "Exactly k out of n" | Use binomial C(n,k)p^k(1-p)^(n-k) | General B1, BTO 4-5 |
| "Given that" | Use Bayes or conditional | General B2, C1, BTO 7-8 |
| "Expected/average" | Calculate E[X] = Σ x_i P(x_i) | General B3-B5, BTO 1-3 |
| "First time until" | Use geometric E[X] = 1/p | General B5, BTO 4 |
| "All must happen" | Multiply independent probs | General C10, BTO 9 |
| "Each event independently" | Same probability applies | BTO 10 |
| "Reaching target" | Gambler's Ruin formula | General C5-C6 |
| "Rare events" | Use Poisson or complement | General C4, C9, BTO 13-14 |

## 📞 QUICK REFERENCE: WHICH FILE FOR WHAT?

**I want to practice WITHOUT seeing answers** → Use Problems-Only files [26, 28]

**I want to learn the methodology** → Use Practice-With-Solutions files [23, 25]

**I want to check my answers** → Use Solutions-Only files [27, 29]

**I need all formulas** → Use BTO_Formulas_Guide [24]

**I want to understand test format** → Use Beat_Odds_Practice [23]

**I want trading context examples** → Use Optiver_Trading_Prob [25]

## 🎓 FINAL TIPS

1. **Practice under time pressure**: 90 seconds per problem forces you to develop intuition
2. **Track mistakes**: Identify if you're weak on specific concepts
3. **Memorize formulas**: No formula = no chance
4. **Use approximations**: Better fast approximation than slow exact answer
5. **Understand concepts**: Memorizing formulas without understanding wastes time
6. **Mental math matters**: Invest time in quick fraction/decimal conversions
7. **Trust your preparation**: You have 100+ quality problems to practice
